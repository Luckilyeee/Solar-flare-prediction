# Solar-flare-prediction
This project is about Solar flare prediction based on the time series of Solar MagneticField Parameters. The dataset is from Kaggle: **https://www.kaggle.com/c/bigdata2020-flare-prediction/data**. The dataset consists of 5 classes,namely X, M, C, B, and Q. To conduct the solar flare prediction task, the X- and M-classes of solar flares are considered to be positive class to represent the flaring active regions, the C-, B-, and Q-classesof solar flares are considered to be negative class to representthe non-flaring regions. The goal of this project is to conduct a binary classification between flaring (X-  and  M-classes) and non-flaring (C-, B-, and Q-classes) Active Regions. 

I apply traditional machine learning models (Interval-based model,Shaplet-based  model,  and  Dictionary-based  model)  and  deeplearning models (Convolutional Neural Network and MultivariateLong  Short  Term  Memory  Fully  Convolutional  Networks)  to achieve  the  prediction  task.  Their  performances  are  evaluatedby using different metricsâ€“Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score,True  skill  statistic(TSS).
