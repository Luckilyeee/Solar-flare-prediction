# Solar-flare-prediction
This project is about Solar flare prediction based on the time series of Solar MagneticField Parameters. The dataset is from Kaggle: **https://www.kaggle.com/c/bigdata2020-flare-prediction/data**. The dataset consists of 5 classes,namely X, M, C, B, and Q. To conduct the solar flare prediction task, the X- and M-classes of solar flares are considered to be positive class to represent the flaring active regions, the C-, B-, and Q-classesof solar flares are considered to be negative class to representthe non-flaring regions. The goal of this project is to conduct a binary classification between flaring (X-  and  M-classes) and non-flaring (C-, B-, and Q-classes) Active Regions. 

I apply traditional machine learning models (Interval-based model,Shaplet-based  model,  and  Dictionary-based  model)  and  deeplearning models (Convolutional Neural Network and MultivariateLong  Short  Term  Memory  Fully  Convolutional  Networks)  to achieve  the  prediction  task.  Their  performances  are  evaluatedby using different metricsâ€“Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score,True  skill  statistic(TSS).

The dataPrepare.py file is used to generate balanced datasets for our experiments. 

The Traditional_binary_33*60.ipynb (scenario (i) of small dataset) and updating 2_Traditional_binary_33*60.ipynb (scenario (ii) for larger dataset) files are the experimental details for tradictional machine learning in solar flare prediction. 

The 1_Deep_learning_binary_33_60.ipynb (scenario (i) of small dataset), 3_Deep_learning_binary_33_60.ipynb (scenario (ii) , and 2_Deep_learning_binary_33_60.ipynb (much more larger dataset) for larger dataset)files are the experimental details for deep learning in solar flare prediction.
